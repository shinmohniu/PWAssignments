Comments are pieces of text that are not rendered as code in the output.
They remains as plain text within the source code and are neither shown
in the output nor affect the output.
Their purpose mainly is to explain and elaborate on the coding logic. They
describe the code/ part of the code as intended by the programmer. They can
be viewed and reflected upon by the creator as well as others who view the
source code.
Comments can also deactivate a part of code which you do not want to render
for the time being. Such code can be placed within the comment tags.

An example of using comments in an HTML document is provided in 'Outputs' folder.
