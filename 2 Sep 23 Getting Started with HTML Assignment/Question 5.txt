A Doctype Declaration informs the browser about the document to be expected on the webpage.
The HTML Doctype tells the browser that it is an HTML file and other speccifications like
the version of the HTML or the standards
It is not an element or a tag but a null element i.e self closing and without content.
It is used to make sure that the document is parsed in a similar way by different web browsers.
